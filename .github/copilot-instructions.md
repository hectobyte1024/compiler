## Project: SDL Shader Compiler

This is a C++ project for building a domain-specific language shader compiler that translates high-level shader code to GLSL and CUDA.

### Architecture:
- Lexer: Tokenizes input DSL code
- Parser: Builds Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Semantic Analyzer: Type checking and validation
- Code Generators: GLSL and CUDA output backends
- CLI Interface: Command-line tool for compilation

### Target Languages:
- GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)
- CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)

### Status:
✅ Project successfully built and tested
✅ Compiler generates both GLSL and CUDA output
✅ CLI interface working
✅ Example SDL file compiles successfully

### Next Steps for Development:
1. Implement complete parser for all SDL language features
2. Add semantic analysis with type checking
3. Expand code generators with full language support
4. Add optimization passes
5. Implement proper error reporting and recovery
6. Add more comprehensive test suite
